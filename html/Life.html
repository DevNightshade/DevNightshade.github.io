                    My whole childhood was a bit of a mess, even though my parents tried their best at teaching me
                    German, I had to rely on my school to learn it the proper way, but since the German school system in
                    turn relies on everybody’s surroundings to "fill in the gaps" of language knowledge, my German
                    skills were always considered mid at best. Although everybody I meet says to me "that I sound really
                    good" and "know how to use the advanced German tongue", that's sadly not all the criteria needed to get good
                    grades. Analysing and Interpretation are the most important aspects needed to get graded better, in
                    which I have been having the most problems so far.<br /><br />Besides growing up at a disadvantage I
                    managed to finish "the middle school" in 2018 with an overall grading of 2.5 (right between B and C in
                    terms of GPA letters), in 2019 I acquired the GCSE O-levels with 2.3 (B in GPA letters) and completed a
                    “preschool for job and apprenticeships” (Specialised A-levels) [again also] with 2.3. After
                    finishing, I tried my go at a company, but due to covid I got terminated. For this reason, I have
                    sadly wasted that one year in which I could've started my, now, current school, a GCE A-Levels
                    school in Hessen, earlier and would’ve been in my final 13th year instead of my current 12th year.
                    Now I'm at the age of 19, still live at my parents who financially support me in my decision to
                    continue studying.<br /><br />Within my last years of middle school and the 1y GCSE O-Levels school,
                    I found my love in IT which was the main reason I decided to visit the “preschool for jobs […]”.
                    Within that year I, also, discovered my joy in video media creation and editing as hobbies. Now that
                    I’m visiting my current school for GCE-A levels, I also got interested in perhaps studying English
                    in university later on (besides programming or anything IT related, if I decide to study at all that
                    is).<br /><br />My love in games has been present for all I remember, my love in anime started in
                    the midst of my life in middle school at around 2013. A once good friend of mine introduced me into
                    it with the "Elfenlied" series, after getting angry over that (and having watched it) he made up his
                    little prank by recommending “Death Note” and “Steins;Gate”. With those my love in anime has
                    started, not in manga at that time though as I've only just recently started reading any at all.
                    Although I'd say I watch a large genre of anime, I wouldn’t quite say the same for games, I mostly
                    play indies or bigger stuff with friends (see “Freetime” page).<br /><br />But that's it for my
                    short DML(TM), if any questions remain, I'd welcome you to invite me to a chat or call or whatever
                    how it is you'd like to contact me with. I'm always willing to create new accounts and proud myself
                    in fast response times. Anything from a simple "Hello" to a complex chat is always welcome. I might
                    seem shy or introverted but I can promise I’ll warm up in no time :)
