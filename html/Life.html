                    My whole childhood was a bit of a mess. Even though my parents tried their best to teach me German,
                    I had to rely on my school to learn it the proper way. However, since the German school system in
                    turn relies on everybody’s surroundings to "fill in the gaps" of language knowledge, my German
                    skills were always considered average at best. Although everyone I meet tells me "that I sound
                    really good" and "know how to use the advanced German tongue", that's sadly not all of the criteria
                    needed to get good grades. Analysis and interpretation are the most important aspects needed to get
                    better grades, and these are the areas where I have had the most problems so far. <br /><br />

                    Despite growing up at a disadvantage, I managed to finish middle school in 2018 with an overall
                    grade of 2.5 (equivalent to a B/C in terms of GPA letters). In 2019, I acquired the GCSE O-levels
                    with a grade of 2.3 (equivalent to a B in GPA letters) and a year later completed a "preschool for
                    job and apprenticeships" (specialized A-levels) with a grade of 2.3 as well. After finishing, I
                    tried my hand at a company, but due to COVID, I was terminated. For this reason, I sadly wasted that
                    one year in which I could have started my current school, a GCE A-Levels school in Hessen, earlier,
                    and would have been in my final 13th year instead of my current 12th year. Now at the age of 20, I
                    still live with my parents, who financially support me in my decision to continue studying.
                    <br /><br />

                    During my last years of middle school and the year I spent at the GCSE O-levels school, I found my
                    love for IT, which was the main reason I decided to attend the "preschool for jobs." During that
                    year, I also discovered joy in programming, creating and editing (video) media as a hobby. Now
                    that I am attending my current school for GCE-A levels, I have also become interested in perhaps
                    studying English in university later on (in addition to programming or anything IT-related, if I
                    decide to study at all). <br /><br />

                    I've tried a lot of different things within programming-related topics. Such as the engines listed
                    on the "Homepage" in "Tools of trade". I started programming in 2016, using GM:S 1, but gave up
                    after hitting a wall due to young age and non-understanding of anything too complex to code. Yet,
                    having learned C++ and later on C# for 1y in 2019/20, it wasn't hard to get into Java (req. for my
                    then apprenticeship). These are reasons why I've tried the handvoll of IDEs listed. <br /><br />

                    My love for games has been present for as long as I can remember, but my love for anime started in
                    the middle of my middle school years, around 2013. A once good friend of mine introduced me to it
                    with "Elfenlied". After getting angry over that (and having watched it), he made up for his prank
                    by recommending "Death Note" and "Steins;Gate." With those, my love for anime started taking off,
                    although not in manga at that time, as I have only recently started reading any. Although I'd say
                    I watch a wide range of anime, I cannot say the same for games. I mostly play indies or larger
                    games with friends (see "Freetime" page for ex.). <br /><br />

                    Apart from all of the above, I've been diagnosed to have keen earing sense, which is why I don't
                    particularly learned to listen to music, as anything related to electronic (from use of such within
                    music to everyday devices) will in some way irritate my ears, or worse, make me feel pain,
                    sick/nauseas. To give an example, my windows media sound volume is always at 10% for my headphones,
                    even with this, I always make sure to quieten down any game I play to around 60% (40% music). It's
                    hard to say how it is on YouTube, because there's a lot of factors (such as distance to mics' or
                    general opt. of video media BTS), LTT videos are usually at 20%, while Markiplier is at around 40%.

                    But that's it for my short DML™. If any questions remain, please feel free to invite me to a chat
                    or call, or whatever method you prefer to contact me. I'm always willing to create new accounts
                    and pride myself on fast response times. Anything from a simple "Hello" to a complex chat is always
                    welcome. Although I might seem shy or introverted, I can promise I'll warm up in no time :)
