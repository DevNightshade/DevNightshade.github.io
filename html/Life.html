                    My whole childhood was a bit of a mess. Even though my parents tried their best to teach me German,
                    I had to rely on my school to learn it the proper way. However, since the German school system in
                    turn relies on everybody’s surroundings to "fill in the gaps" of language knowledge, my German
                    skills were always considered average at best. Although everyone I meet tells me "that I sound
                    really good" and "know how to use the advanced German tongue", that's sadly not all of the criteria
                    needed to get good grades. Analysis and interpretation are the most important aspects needed to get
                    better grades, and these are the areas where I have had the most problems so far.<br /><br />

                    Despite growing up at a disadvantage, I managed to finish middle school in 2018 with an overall
                    grade of 2.5 (equivalent to a B/C in terms of GPA letters). In 2019, I acquired the GCSE O-levels
                    with a grade of 2.3 (equivalent to a B in GPA letters) and completed a "preschool for job and
                    apprenticeships" (specialized A-levels) with a grade of 2.3 as well. After finishing, I tried my
                    hand at a company, but due to COVID, I was terminated. For this reason, I sadly wasted that one year
                    in which I could have started my current school, a GCE A-Levels school in Hessen, earlier, and would
                    have been in my final 13th year instead of my current 12th year. Now at the age of 19, I still live
                    with my parents, who financially support me in my decision to continue studying.<br /><br />

                    During my last years of middle school and the year I spent at the GCSE O-levels school, I found my
                    love for IT, which was the main reason I decided to attend the "preschool for jobs." During that
                    year, I also discovered my joy in creating and editing video media as a hobby. Now that I am
                    attending my current school for GCE-A levels, I have also become interested in perhaps studying
                    English in university later on (in addition to programming or anything IT-related, if I decide to
                    study at all).<br /><br />

                    My love for games has been present for as long as I can remember, and my love for anime started in
                    the middle of my middle school years, around 2013. A once good friend of mine introduced me to it
                    with the "Elfenlied" series. After getting angry over that (and having watched it), he made up for
                    his little prank by recommending "Death Note" and "Steins;Gate." With those, my love for anime
                    started, although not in manga at that time, as I have only recently started reading any. Although
                    I'd say I watch a wide range of anime, I cannot say the same for games. I mostly play indies or
                    larger games with friends (see "Freetime" page).<br /><br />

                    But that's it for my short DML (TM). If any questions remain, please feel free to invite me to a
                    chat or call, or whatever method you prefer to contact me with. I'm always willing to create new
                    accounts and pride myself on fast response times. Anything from a simple "Hello" to a complex chat
                    is always welcome. Although I might seem shy or introverted, I can promise I'll warm up in no time
                    :)
