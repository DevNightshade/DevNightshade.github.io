                    <div class="contact">
                        My entire childhood was somewhat chaotic. Despite my parents’ best efforts to teach me German, I had
                        to rely on my school for proper instruction. However, since the German school system depends on
                        students’ surroundings to supplement language skills, my proficiency in German has always been
                        considered average at best. Although I have been told that I can speak eloquently and use academic
                        German effectively, this alone is not sufficient for achieving high grades. Analysis and
                        interpretation are two crucial skills required for academic success and these are areas where I have
                        struggled. <br /><br />

                        Despite these challenges, I successfully completed middle school in 2018 with an overall grade of
                        2.5 (equivalent to a B-/C+ in terms of GPA letters). In 2019, I obtained GCSE O-levels with a grade
                        of 2.3 (equivalent to a B in GPA letters) and a year later completed a specialized A-levels program
                        for job and apprenticeship preparation with a grade of 2.3 (B) as well. After completing this
                        program, I attempted to enter the workforce but was terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a
                        result, I lost one year that could have been spent starting my current GCE A-Levels program earlier
                        and would now be in my final 13th year instead of my current 12th year. <br /><br />

                        During my last years of middle school (2015 - 18) and the year (2019) spent at the GCSE O-levels
                        school, I discovered my passion for information technology (IT), which motivated me to attend a
                        specialized program for job and apprenticeship preparation. During that year, I also developed an
                        interest in programming and creating and editing video media as a hobby. Now that I am attending a
                        GCE A-Levels program, I have also become interested in studying English at university in addition to
                        programming or other IT-related subjects. <br /><br />

                        I have experimented with various programming-related topics and tools listed on my homepage. I began
                        programming in 2016 using GameMaker Studio 1 but stopped after encountering difficulties due to my
                        young age and lack of understanding of complex coding concepts. However, after learning C++ and
                        later C# for one year in 2019/20, it was not difficult for me to learn Java as it was required for
                        my former apprenticeship (and is also used at my current school). <br /><br />

                        My love for games has been present for as long as I can remember but my interest in anime began
                        during middle school around 2013 when a friend introduced me to the world of anime with “Elfen
                        Lied”. After initially being upset by this recommendation (as I felt it was inappropriate), he
                        recommended “Death Note” and “Steins;Gate” which sparked my love for anime. Although I watch a wide
                        range of anime, I cannot say the same for games. <br /><br />

                        In addition to these interests, I have been diagnosed with keen hearing sensitivity which has made
                        it difficult for me to enjoy music as electronic sounds can irritate my ears or cause discomfort or
                        pain. For example, I keep the volume on my computer’s media player at 10% when using headphones and
                        reduce the volume of games to around 60% (40% music). The volume level varies on YouTube depending
                        on factors such as microphone distance or behind-the-scenes production; Linus Tech Tips videos are
                        usually at 20% while Markiplier videos are around 40%. <br /><br />

                        That concludes my brief personal history. If you have any further questions or would like to contact
                        me via chat or call or another method of your preference, please feel free to do so. I am always
                        willing to create new accounts and pride myself on fast response times. Although I may appear shy or
                        introverted at first, I promise that I will quickly warm up.
