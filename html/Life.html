                <article>
					My whole childhood was a bit of a mess, even though my parents tried their best at teaching me German, I had to rely on my school to learn it the proper way, but since the 
					German school system in turn relies on everybody’s surroundings to "fill in the gaps" of language knowledge, my German skills were always considered mid at best. Although 
					everybody I meet says to me that I sound really good and use the "advanced German tongue", that's sadly not all the criteria needed to get good grades. Analysing and 
					Interpretation are the most important aspects needed to get graded better, in which I have been having the most problems so far.<br /><br />Besides growing up at a 
					disadvantage I managed to finish the middle school in 2018 with an overall grading of 2.5 (right between B and C in terms of American Grades), in 2019 I achieved GCSE 
					O-levels with 2.3 (B-) and completed a “preschool for job and apprenticeships” (also considered GCSE O-levels) [again also] with 2.3. After finishing a tried my go at a company, 
					but due to covid reasons I got terminated. For this reason, I have sadly wasted that one year in which I could've started my current school, a GCE A-Levels school in Hessen, 
					earlier and would’ve been in my final 13th year instead of the current 12th year. Now although I'm at the age of 19, I'm still living at my parents who financially support 
					me in my decision to continue studying.<br /><br />Within my last years of middle school and the 1y GCSE O-Levels school, I found my love in IT which was the main reason I decided 
					to visit the “preschool for jobs”. Within that year I discovered my joy in video media creation and editing as a hobby and narrowed my dream job down to programmer. Now that 
					I’m visiting my current school for GCE-A levels, I also got interested in perhaps studying English in university later on (besides programming or anything IT related, if I decide 
					to study at all that is).<br /><br />My love in Games has been present for all I remember, my love in Anime started in the midst of my life in middle school at around 2013. 
					A once good friend of mine introduced me into it with "Elfenlied", after getting angry over that (and having watched it) he made up with recommending Death Note and Steins;Gate.
					With those my love in Anime has started, Manga not so much at that point, with reasons of me having child trauma of my parents "forcing me" to literally read till I fall over, I've
					only recently started reading any at all. Although I'd say I watch a large genre of Anime, I don't have the same interest in genre for Manga as of yet. The only ones I'd be willing
					to watch are MCs with OP abilities, not only that but in coloured only... A bit weird as to why my brain is strict with those criteria.<br /><br />But that's it for a short DML(TM),
					if any questions remain, I'd welcome you to invite me to a chat or call or whatever how it is you'd like to contact me with. I'm always willing to create new accounts and proud
					myself in fast response times. Anything from a simple "Hello" to a complex chat is welcome :)
